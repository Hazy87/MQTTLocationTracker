# MQTTLocationTracker
UWP app that tracks location and sends it through MQTT. This app was specifically built to work as the [Owntracks device tracker](http://owntracks.org/) and home automation systems such as [Home Assistant](http://www.home-assistant.io).
The reason this exists is that Owntracks does not have a Windows app.

*Privacy policy*
This app does not store nor collect any privacy sensitive information. It will request the location of your device and send it to whatever broker you instruct it to. Your data is never send anywhere else nor stored.
