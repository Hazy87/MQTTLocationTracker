# MQTTLocationTracker
UWP app that tracks location and sends it through MQTT. This app was specifically built to work as the [Owntracks device tracker](http://owntracks.org/) and home automation systems such as [Home Assistant](http://www.home-assistant.io).
The reason this exists is that Owntracks does not have a Windows app.
